Basic Script for obtaining Badges in Slap battles, **ONLY** use this if you're really stuck...
#
I'm gonna leave this as it is because of the fact I keep getting enforcement bans in sb
#
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/water5202/Slap-Battles-Auto-Badges/refs/heads/main/AutoBadgeLoader.lua"))()
```
#
Thanks for using the GUI
